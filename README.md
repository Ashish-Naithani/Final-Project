# 🌍 Global CO₂ Emission Tracker

This project provides a comprehensive view of **global CO₂ emissions** over multiple years, helping visualize patterns and sector-wise contributions to emissions.  
It was developed while working as a **Data Analyst at Elevate Labs**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
The Global CO₂ Emission Tracker combines **data wrangling** and **data visualization** to make large-scale emission datasets more understandable.  
Key features include:
- Importing and analyzing a **multi-year emissions dataset**  
- Cleaning and preprocessing data using **Python**  
- Adding a **total emissions column** that sums values across all available years  
- Creating **interactive dashboards in Power BI** with maps and bar graphs by sector  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy) – for data cleaning and preprocessing  
- **Power BI** – for creating dashboards and interactive visualizations  
- **Excel/CSV datasets** – as the raw data source  

---

## 📊 Dashboards
The Power BI dashboard includes:  
- **Global Map View**: Country-wise emissions across years  
- **Sector-wise Bar Graphs**: Showing contribution by energy, transport, industry, etc.  
- **Total Emissions Tracker**: Summing up all available data till now  

---

## 🚀 Insights
- Identified **regional differences** in emission trends  
- Compared **sector-level contributions** to total emissions  
- Built a structure that can be **extended with future data updates**
