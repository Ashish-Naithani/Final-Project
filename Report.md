# üìñ Project Report: IMDB Movie Success Prediction

## ‚ú® Introduction

Movies are more than just entertainment ‚Äî they are big investments, and predicting their success is a challenge that excites both filmmakers and data scientists.
In this project, carried out during my time as a Data Analyst at Elevate Labs, I explored how audience reviews, ratings, and sentiment can be leveraged to predict a movie‚Äôs box office performance.

The goal was to combine machine learning with sentiment analysis and create meaningful insights through interactive dashboards.

## üìå Methodology
   1. Data Collection & Preparation:
         Imported IMDB movie, rating, and review datasets.
         Cleaned and structured data for consistency and accuracy.

   2. Sentiment Analysis:
         Used VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) to measure positivity, negativity, neutrality, and compound sentiment in user reviews.
         Generated average sentiment scores at the movie and genre level.

   3. Predictive Modeling with Random Forest:
         Developed a Random Forest Regressor to predict box office collections using features such as IMDB ratings, sentiment scores, and genre data.
         Tuned hyperparameters for better accuracy and model stability.
         Evaluated the model using R¬≤, MAE, and RMSE to assess predictive performance.
   4. Genre-Wise Insights
         Segmented movies by genre to analyze audience response.
         Identified that Drama and Action genres showed stronger correlations between sentiment and success.

   5. Visualization & Storytelling
      Designed Power BI dashboards to make insights interactive and easy to explore.
      Dashboards highlighted sentiment patterns, predicted vs actual box office performance, and genre-wise comparisons.
